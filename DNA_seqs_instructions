CREATE DNA SEQUENCE ASSINGMENT INSTRUCTIONS:

Here's a short DNA sequence: 
ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTATTTGCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT 
Write a program that will print out the AT content of this DNA sequence. Hint: you can use normal mathematical symbols like add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/) and parentheses to carry out calculations on numbers in Python. 



sequence= "ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTATTTGCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT"

# count As and Ts and add together
ATcontent=sequence.count("A") + sequence.count("T")

# print at content statement (not ideal formatting here)
print('there are ', ATcontent, 'As and Ts in the sequence')




Here's a short DNA sequence: 
ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTAGAATTCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT 
The sequence contains a recognition site for the EcoRI restriction enzyme, which cuts at the motif G*AATTC (the position of the cut is indicated by an asterisk). 
Write a program which will calculate the size of the two fragments that will be produced when the DNA sequence is digested with EcoRI. 


sequence="ACTGATCGATTACGTATAGTAGAATTCTATCATACATATATATCGATGCGTTCAT"
cutsite=sequence.find("GAATTC")

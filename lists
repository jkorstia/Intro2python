#GOAL: Determine length of large genes on mRNA strand
#Assumptions: Genes are recognized as segments of RNA separated by start codon AUG
#1 Generate a random RNA sequence into a STRING 1000 base pairs long
#2 Create list of genes that are separated by start codon
#3 Create list of large genes (>50bp) 
#4 Determine length of large genes
##3 and #4 must be done TWICE: once with a loop and once with list comprehension
#* If your 1st fragment in #2 does not start with AUG (which is probably won’t), do not try to overcomplicate this.  Just consider it one of the fragments and proceed forward….

# imort needed modules
import random


# create a list of bases to randomly choose from
bases = ["A", "C", "U", "G"]

# make a list of 100 random basess
sequence = random.choices(bases, k=1000)

#convert list to string
seqStr = ' '.join([str(elem) for elem in sequence])

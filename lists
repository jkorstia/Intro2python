#GOAL: Determine length of large genes on mRNA strand
#Assumptions: Genes are recognized as segments of RNA separated by start codon AUG
#1 Generate a random RNA sequence into a STRING 1000 base pairs long
#2 Create list of genes that are separated by start codon
#3 Create list of large genes (>50bp) 
#4 Determine length of large genes
##3 and #4 must be done TWICE: once with a loop and once with list comprehension
#* If your 1st fragment in #2 does not start with AUG (which is probably wonâ€™t), do not try to overcomplicate this.  Just consider it one of the fragments and proceed forwardâ€¦.

# imort needed modules
import random


# create a list of bases to randomly choose from
bases = ["A", "C", "U", "G"]

# make a string of 1000 random bases
# here the .join command joins the list output from random.choices into an empty string
sequence = ''.join(random.choices(bases, k=1000))

# look at sequence to make sure its correctly formatted
print(sequence)
